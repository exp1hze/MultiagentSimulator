Try starting with this to create a 2D foraging problem to test response
probability work.

Added code that automatically prints out gnuplot files for plotting
the output data.

So far, prints two gnuplot files.

run.x.gnu is a gnuplot file that plots multiple types of data.
Printed with the "gnu" output file flag is on.

run.x.agentstepmemory.gnu is printed when the "Print_agent_memory"
flag is on.
Prints heatmaps of the agents individual memories and of the final
average memory (averaged across all agents in the final timestep).
Also plots food locations.

Code is working.

Agents can select the next cell on a path using either proportional or rank
selection.  If all cells have equal value, explicitly use random selection.

Added the process ID to the random seed to ensure that each random seed is
different.  This was a patch.  At some point, need to consider re-doing the
random routines.

Gnuplot files generated by gnu.c printed that will generate the memory maps 
for each agent in each step, and also the average memory map (averaged across 
all agents) in the final step.

The Gnuplot directory contains plot.c which calculates and generates gnuplot
files to plot average (and stdev and CI) data across multiple runs.

Agents can be killed off mid-run.  No controlled via params file; is hard
coded in the code at this time.  Code to do that is in:
step_start() in fxn.c

update_memory() in agent.c contains code for updating an agent's memory of
its explorations.  This is where the positive and negative reinforcement of
paths (cells in path) occurs, and this is where I would turn one or the other
on or off in the code (cannot do that via params file right now).

The file plot.c in the directory Gnuplot aggregates data that is
averaged over the multiple runs and prints plot.gnu to plot that data.
Aggregated data printed to data files called data_agent_average.dat and
data_nest_average.dat.

I think the code, data collection, and plotting functionality are ready
for experiments.

Back up code before following change:

When agents move along path, instead of marking path with a "1", mark it
with the step number.  If agent returns to a cell, it will be marked again
so cells will always be marked with latest visit.  This will allow the agent
to reinforce the start and end of the paths differently.

plot.c in Gnuplot directory averages data across runs and creates gnuplot
files for plotting data.

Ready for experiments.

#ifdef KILL 
in fxn.c comments out the code that kills agents periodically during a run.
