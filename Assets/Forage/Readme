Try starting with this to create a 2D foraging problem to test response
probability work.

Using this code for the response probability paper.
Currently, the code allows x agents to forage in each trial, regardless
of the amount of food the x agents bring in.  I keep track of the food
brought in and we see that the amount retrieved per trial increases with
multiple trials (experience improves performance) and when the first
x agents are killed off, the remaining agents must relearn the task (food
amount drops and then slowly comes back up).

Freezing this code for now.

Will copy this code into an new directory called
1902.mas.forage.resprob.foodgoal
in which the system will continue to send out agents in a trial until
a specified food amount is brought in.  The number of agents sent out
should drop over time, as the early agents get more opportunities to learn
and get better.  This scenario makes more sense from a practical standpoint.

It turns out the above change is very easy to make. 
All I need to do is make the following change in step_run() in fxn.c:

Replace
   //while (num_acted < Nest.need && i < Pop_size)
with
   while (Nest.step_income < 3 && i < Pop_size)

so I can specify a fixed amount of food to bring in.

I'm not making additional changes to the code in 
1902.mas.forage.resprob.foodgoal
at this time.  I'd like to keep 1902.mas.forage.resprob as the
current copy for now.

Holding off an experiments with 1902.mas.forage.resprob.foodgoal
but keeping the directory for now.
The initial test runs that I did today gave results that were not conclusive.
When I have time to get back to that code, might want to track and look 
at ratio of candidates vs actors.

Will write paper with current experiments for now.

Copied from ~aswu/ucf.old/code/1902.mas.forage.resprob/.
Create new bitbucket repository to share with David Mathias at UWL.
Renamed directory to 2004.forage/, but it originated from 
1902.mas.forage.resprob/.

To compile:   make
To run:       sim params opfiles
